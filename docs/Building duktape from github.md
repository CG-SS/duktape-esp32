# Building duktape from Github
To use the latest versions of Duktape, we will want to build our own version from the
source contained on Github.  Here is the recipe.

1. Clone a copy of the Github repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/svaarala/duktape.git
```


We now have the Duktape source where it needs to be (`$ESP32_DUKTAPE/components/duktape`) however it needs some
fixup.

1. Create the `component.mk` file.  In order to be part of an ESP-IDF build, there must be a `component.mk`
in the `duktape` directory.  This should contains:

```
COMPONENT_ADD_INCLUDEDIRS:=src extras/module-duktape examples/debug-trans-socket
COMPONENT_SRCDIRS:=src extras/module-duktape examples/debug-trans-socket
```

2. Change the `duk_trans_socket_unix.c` file.  This is a sample file that provides Debug support for Duktape
using TCP/IP sockets.  Unfortunately, ESP32 isn't exactly compliant (yet).  Specifically, the header
file called `<netinet/in.h>` is not present in ESP32.   In addition, we need to add

```
#define USE_SELECT
```

at the top of the file as ESP32 doesn't support the `poll()` system call.

3. Remove the file `$ESP32_DUKTAPE/components/duktape/examples/debug-trans-socket/duk_trans_socket_windows.c`.  The
ESP-IDF build systems wants to compile ALL files in a directory ... and this means that files we don't
want (such as Windows support) will also be compiled by default.

4. Now we configure our version of duktape to use the low memory profile:

```
python tools/configure.py \
    --config-metadata config/ \
    --source-directory src-input \
    --option-file components/duktape/config/examples/low_memory.yaml \
    --option-file data/duktape/ESP32-Duktape.yaml \
    --output-directory src
```

ESP32-Duktape uses two distinct file systems.  One called "SPIFFS" and the other called "ESPFS".  The source
and tools for these are:

* [spiffs](https://github.com/whitecatboard/Lua-RTOS-ESP32/tree/master/components)
* [espfs] (https://github.com/Spritetm/libesphttpd/tree/master/espfs)

However the tools needed to build them are supplied in the `./bin` directory.
